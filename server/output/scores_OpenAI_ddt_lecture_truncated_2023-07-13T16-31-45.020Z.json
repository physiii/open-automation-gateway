          "explanation": "Bacteria are single-celled organisms that can live almost anywhere - in soil, the ocean, even inside humans and other animals. They can reproduce on their own through cellular division. On the other hand, Helminths are larger, multicellular organisms, often referred to as worms. They cannot multiply inside humans and are often visible to the naked eye. They typically lay eggs inside the body of the host which then get excreted and ingested by another host to continue their lifecycle.",
